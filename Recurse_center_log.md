- got jekyll previewing working on my computer

##Day 3 Nov 11

goals:
- attend Choosing projects session 3-4pm
- continue with D3 tutorials
- cracking the coding interview questions?

--------------------------------------

what I ended up doing:
- Lots of D3, although, I don’t know how much progress I made with that. I still don’t really understand any of it. :(
- Went to Choosing Projects session

##Day 4 Nov 12

goals:
- More D3, and getting help with this
-

what I ended up doing:
- attended git workshop
- finished chapter 2 from G and H


ideas for projects:
- scrape google calendar or timetracker data and visualise
- something to do with... food, knitting, origami
- recipe mashup
- twitter scraping
- is there any data available for recursers e.g. age, etc.

## Day 7 Nov 15

goals:
- finish blog post week 1 x
- playing with d3 x

Conversation with Chris:
Try and get experience with - 
- network X
- scikit-learn
- Spark/AWS
- it's ok to do cousera/tutorials

Plan for the week ahead:

- Pair on JS stuff. Finalise ideas for a big project
- http://www.cheese.com/isle-of-mull/
- markets of ny 
- ml kaggle

## Day 8 Nov 16

- Paired with javier all day on d3. Managed ot get the rebound thing working, added sounds!
- Did most of the questions at the end of G and H chapter 1.

## Day 9 Nov 17

goals:
- Read (half?) of ch 3 G and H
- Continue with d3, link sounds with height of bars, make an orchestra

possible places I could go from here:
- keep playing with sounds and exand this so that there are several instruments
- load up some actual data, do some graphs with axes etc. 

what I ended up doing:
- read some of G and H chapter 3 (the book arrived!)
- got sounds matched to bar height in d3. Paired with Mary. Played with different data inputs e.g. sine wave. Failed at adding axes.

## Day 10 Nov 18

- Finish G and H chapter 3
- Load up some actual data to d3, do some graphs with axes e.g. stock exchange, Google nGrams etc.
- buy a hairdryer
- think about accommodation 

what I ended up doing:
- did some of chapter 3 but didn't finish D:
- got actual data working in d3; javier helped. csv needs to have actual commas. Also accessing the data need to reference the actual values, not just the ... whatever 
- went to Mary's talk about functional programming; I want to do some pairing on this with Lauren tomorrow, maybe

## Day 11 Nov 19

- Finish G and H chapter 3!!
- Do osme pairing with Lauren on functional Python
- either continue with my visualisation, link up to some external data sources, or make a new map thingy
- where is all the cheese? 

What I actually did:

- Almost finished ch 3... need to do the exercises
- paired with Lauren on functional programming in Python. This was hard, and I wasn't good at it :(


## Day 12 Nov 20
- Whiteboarding interview practice

#Day 15 Monday 23 Nov
- Chapter 4 of G and H
- think about and choose a big project I want to do. Make a list of skills I want to learn and ideas for projects, then talk to John about it.

-------------
what I actually did:
- Read half of ch 4
- thought about projects a lot
- Talked to John about projects. He recommended try starting on something small, e.g. the twitter API, and then see where I am from there. 
- He suggested integrating things with twillio
- paired with David in the afternoon on his bikeshare data

tomorrow:
play with the twitter API, 

#Day 16 Tuesday 24 Nov
Read a lot of the Twitter API
Wrote/copied a small script to interact with the Twitter stream API. Filtered by hashtag 'GRAMMYs'.
Worked out how to read this into a python pandas dataframe. Basically, each line is a json object, and some of those objects have NESTED objects, but for some of the tweets certain keys don't exist at all
So reading into pandas requires a map and dealing with errors
